            <h3 id="French Press">French Press</h3>
            <p>The French Press method, invented in 1929, is widely considered as the best and easiest method for brewing superior and consistent coffee. It extracts, arguably, more superior flavours than any other method. In a press pot, ground coffee is soaked, steeped and strained in hot water; therefore, coffeeâ€™s flavourful essential oils, caffeine and antioxidants are better diffused and preserved leaving the purest flavours of the coffee. It is well suited for coffee drinkers that enjoy a luscious, expressive and complex taste experience. .</p>

            <h3 id="AeroPress">AeroPress</h3>
            <p>Relatively new, the maker of Aerobie Frisbee (Alan Adler) created and launched the AeroPress in 2005. The AeroPress is plastic and comes in 3 parts. A filter sits in a coffee basket at the bottom of the brew chamber. Coffee grounds rest in the brew chamber where hot water is added then immerses/steeps the coffee. To extract the coffee, a plunger is pressed down creating air pressure to force brewed coffee through a filter and into a cup.</p>

                <h3 id="ColdBrew">Cold Brew</h3>
                <p> Cold brew coffee is a type of coffee that is brewed using cold or room temperature water over an extended period of time, typically 12 to 24 hours. Unlike traditional hot brewed coffee, which is brewed quickly with hot water, cold brew coffee is made by steeping coffee grounds in cold water for an extended period of time. This slow brewing process results in a coffee that is less acidic and smoother in taste, with a slightly sweet and nutty flavor profile.</p>

                <p> Moka pot coffee, also known as stove-top espresso or espresso pot coffee, is a strong and flavorful coffee brewed using a Moka pot. A Moka pot is a type of coffee maker that works by using steam pressure to force water through finely ground coffee beans, producing a strong and concentrated coffee that is similar in taste to espresso.</p>

                <h3 id="CoffeeCone">Pour Over/Drip: Coffee Cone</h3>
                <p> Pour over or drip coffee is a method of brewing coffee that involves pouring hot water over a bed of coffee grounds in a coffee cone or dripper. The water slowly filters through the coffee grounds and into a carafe or mug below, resulting in a clean and smooth cup of coffee with a bright and nuanced flavor profile.</p>
                <p>
                 A coffee cone or dripper is typically made of ceramic, plastic, or glass and consists of a funnel-shaped holder that rests on top of a coffee mug or carafe. A paper filter is placed inside the cone and filled with a precise amount of coffee grounds. Hot water is then poured slowly over the coffee grounds in a circular motion, allowing the water to extract the flavors and oils from the coffee and drip through the filter into the cup or carafe below.</p>

                <h3 id="Chemex">Pour Over/Drip: Chemex</h3>
                <p>Pour over or drip coffee using a Chemex is a method of brewing coffee that involves using a Chemex coffee maker, which is a glass carafe with a distinctive hourglass shape and a conical paper filter.</p>
                <p>
                    The unique design of the Chemex allows for greater control over the brewing process and produces a coffee that is clean, crisp, and flavorful, with a well-rounded taste profile. The paper filter used in the Chemex also removes any unwanted sediment and oils, resulting in a smoother and more refined cup of coffee.</p>
